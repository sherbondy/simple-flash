# Simple Flash

[See the app live](http://simple-flash.appspot.com)

A simple flashcard web application for studying vocabulary words, intended for deployment on [Google App Engine](https://appengine.google.com).

I wrote this back in high school, and I'm open sourcing it at the request of one Mr. Owen Wang. The code is probably pretty awful, but at least now it's available for hacking on.

Hackers gonna hack.

Feel free to report issues, and maybe one fateful day I'll actually try and fix them. Pull requests are much appreciated.

Simple Flash was designed to work well on both conventional PCs (with keyboard navigation) and touch-screen devices.

Enjoy!
